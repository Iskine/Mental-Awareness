        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> While we all feel sad, moody or low from time to time, 
            some people experience these feelings intensely, for long 
            periods of time (weeks, months or even years) and sometimes 
            without any apparent reason. Depression is more than just 
            a low mood – it's a serious condition that has an impact on both physical and mental health.

    <section class="sec2">
        <p> Depression affects how people think, feel and act. Depression makes it more 
            difficult to manage from day to day and interferes with study, work and 
            relationships. A person may be depressed if for more than two weeks they have 
            felt sad, down or miserable most of the time or have lost interest or pleasure 
            in most of their usual activities, and have also experienced several of the
            signs and symptoms across at least three of the categories in the list below. 
            It’s important to note, everyone experiences some of these symptoms from time 
            to time and it may not necessarily mean a person is depressed. Equally,
            not every person who is experiencing depression will have all of these symptoms.
