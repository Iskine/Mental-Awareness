        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health problems. 
            They include generalised anxiety disorders, social phobias, specific phobias 
            (for example, agoraphobia and claustrophobia), 
            and panic disorders. Depression is often related to anxiety disorders.
            Anxiety disorders are common mental health problems that affect many people. 
            Approximately 25% of the population have an anxiety disorder that warrants treatment 
            at some time in their life and up to another 25% have 
            less severe anxieties such as fears of spider and snakes.

    <section class="sec2">
        <p> The main features of an anxiety disorder are fears or 
            thoughts that are chronic (constant) and distressing and
            that interfere with daily living.Other symptoms of an 
            anxiety disorder may include:
            Panic or anxiety attacks or a fear of these attacks.
            Physical anxiety reactions – for example trembling, sweating, 
            faintness, rapid heartbeat, difficulties breathing or nausea.
            Avoidance behaviour – a person may go to extreme lengths to avoid a 
            situation that they think could bring on anxiety or panic. A panic attack is a sudden
            feeling of intense terror that may occur in certain situations or for no apparent reason. 
            A panic attack does not mean a person is necessarily suffering an anxiety disorder. 
            Panic attacks can be frightening.
