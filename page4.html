        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder that 
            affects two to three percent of the population (more than 500,000 Australians). 
            It usually begins in late childhood or early adolescence. People with OCD 
            experience recurrent and persistent thoughts, images or impulses that are 
            intrusive and unwanted (obsessions).

    <section class="sec2">
        <p> Obsessions may be constantly on a person’s mind. They may also be 
            triggered by physical objects, situations, smells or something heard 
            on television, radio or in a conversation. Obsessive fears usually 
            move beyond a specific trigger – for example, a bottle of coolant – 
            to include anything that might look like it or have been near it, 
            such as cars, car keys, a puddle on the road, supermarket shelves 
            and petrol stations. Obsessions can change in nature and severity 
            and do not respond to logic. Obsessional anxiety leads to vigilance 
            for possible threats, and a compelling need for certainty and control. 
            Obsessions can produce feelings ranging from annoyance and discomfort 
            to acute distress, disgust and panic.
