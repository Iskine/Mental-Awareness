        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses. They can 
            affect people of all age groups, genders, backgrounds and 
            cultures. The number of people with eating disorders is 
            increasing. We understand more about eating disorders now 
            than ever before. Yet, many people live with these disorders
             for a long time without a clinical diagnosis or treatment.
